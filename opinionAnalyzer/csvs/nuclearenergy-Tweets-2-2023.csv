Unfortunately, it is unlikely to go anywhere, as POTUS recognizes the importance of #nuclear energy to not only the US, but also global #climate policy & mitigation.

Doubly unfortunate, the western (üá∫üá∏üá®üá¶üá´üá∑üá¨üáßüáØüáµ) nuclear industry has not come to terms with its own safe-made failures over the past decades, resulting in a lack of competitiveness in the global #nuclearenergy market.

This has resulted in a vacuum in the global nuclear energy market, preventing western countries to extend western values to nations in the Global South through energy.  

A vacuum #russia, through @RosatomGlobal, has been happy to fill and expand their values and curry influence in matters extending far beyond just energy security.

POTUS has no options other than to reward western nuclear energy failures, not only to promote western energy, but also to offer an alternative to russia's effective dominance in its ability to build nuclear power plants for America's allies & adversaries alike.

This in a nutshell is why #Sanctions against russia's behemoth nuclear industry are highly unlikely to occur and why US nuclear lobbyists headed to Capitol Hill in the days and weeks immediately following russia's re-invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24th.
