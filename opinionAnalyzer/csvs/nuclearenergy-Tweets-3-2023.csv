üíªüîåüí∞ Terawulf Launches First Bitcoin Mining Powered by Nuclear Energy in US

Terawulf, a company engaged in Bitcoin mining, announced that it has launched the first Bitcoin mining installation powered by nuclear energy in the United States at Nautilus company in Pennsylvania. According to the company, approximately 1 exahash per second (EH/s) or around 8000 bitcoin miners with integrated circuits are currently connected to the network, and another 8000 mining units will be delivered soon.

According to the company's press release on Nautilus energization, Terawulf will receive a fixed electricity tariff of about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the next five years.

The Nautilus facility is considered a milestone, as it is the first Bitcoin mining enterprise of its kind to receive 24/7 carbon-free energy from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

Seven days ago, Mawson Infrastructure Group launched a mining company in Pennsylvania, after leaving Australia. In addition to the 50 MW Nautilus installation, Terawulf announced an expansion of operations at its Lake Mariner facility in New York. This move will increase Lake Mariner's capacity from 60 MW to 110 MW.

We are witnessing the extreme centralization of mining in the US, which has already captured the lion's share of the world's hash rate. And the problem here is not only that the main mining pools are located in one country. A couple of years ago, the lion's share of mining pools were in China. The problem is precisely that there are no pools in the US at all.

Previously, the dominance of Chinese pools in the Bitcoin network was a concern, but most of these pools could be joined by a miner from anywhere in the world, and only one was purely Chinese. All others were open to miners from any country. Now, in the US, there is a mega-concentration of miners at individual companies, with no possibility for third-party players to join their pools.

Moreover, the cooperation of large energy companies and nuclear power plants, owned by Goldman Sachs' investment division, raises suspicion that the most active bank in the crypto industry wants to concentrate almost all Bitcoin mining in its hands.

For example, the Chief Strategy Officer of this largest atomic miner in the US, Kerri Langlais, attracted funding to buy these 8000 miners easily. Again, by a strange coincidence, Kerri worked for the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs for the previous 10 years.

üìåConclusion:
Overall, the article highlights the growing importance of energy sources for Bitcoin mining, and the impact that centralized mining power can have on the Bitcoin network.

2023-03-24 16:59:01+00:00,1639310864334352385,"The Truth About Nuclear Energy: A Controversial Solution to Climate Change

The world is facing a critical challenge: how to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. Many experts agree that one potential solution is nuclear energy. However, this solution is not without controversy.

Nuclear energy is produced through the process of nuclear fission, which involves splitting atoms to release energy. This process generates a tremendous amount of energy without producing greenhouse gas emissions, which makes it an attractive option for reducing carbon emissions. Nuclear power plants also have the advantage of being able to operate continuously, unlike solar and wind power, which are intermittent.

Despite its potential benefits, nuclear energy has faced widespread opposition due to several issues. The most significant concern is the potential for nuclear accidents, which can have catastrophic consequences. The most notable example is the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which resulted in the release of radioactive material and caused long-term health effects for those living in the area.

Another concern is the problem of nuclear waste. Nuclear reactors produce radioactive waste that remains hazardous for thousands of years, and there is currently no permanent solution for its disposal. This has led to concerns about the safety of storing nuclear waste and the potential for it to be used in nuclear weapons.

Additionally, the construction and operation of nuclear power plants are expensive and require significant government subsidies. This has led to criticisms that nuclear energy is not economically feasible and that the money could be better spent on other renewable energy sources.

Despite these concerns, some experts argue that nuclear energy is a necessary part of the solution to combat climate change. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report stating that nuclear energy would need to play a significant role in reducing carbon emissions and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Nuclear energy also has the potential to address energy poverty in developing countries. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), around 840 million people worldwide lack access to electricity. Nuclear energy could provide a reliable source of energy to these populations, improving their quality of life and reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.

To address the concerns about nuclear energy, several measures have been proposed. One is to develop safer nuclear reactor designs that are less prone to accidents and produce less waste. Another is to improve the storage and disposal of nuclear waste through the development of advanced technologies.

There is also a need for greater transparency and public engagement in the decision-making process surrounding nuclear energy. This includes educating the public about the risks and benefits of nuclear energy and involving local communities in the siting of nuclear power plants.

In conclusion, nuclear energy is a controversial solution to climate change. While it has the potential to generate significant amounts of energy without producing greenhouse gas emissions, it also poses risks and challenges related to nuclear accidents, nuclear waste, and economic feasibility. However, with the development of safer technologies and greater public engagement, nuclear energy could play a crucial role in the fight against climate change and addressing global energy poverty.",nigroeneveld,0,0,0,0
