As a passionate follower of this technology, I've been closely monitoring the progress of SMRs, which promise a safer, more efficient, and sustainable approach to nuclear power generation.

üá®üá≥üá∑üá∫ While China and Russia are at the forefront of this revolution, companies worldwide are racing to bring SMRs to the market. These compact reactors offer numerous advantages, such as exceptional passive safety features, reduced uranium enrichment requirements (some as low as 8.5%), and extended life cycles of up to 60 years.

üåéüå± SMRs have the potential to address many of the historical challenges associated with nuclear energy, including waste management. The latest report from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) offers a comprehensive overview and dashboard of the current state of SMR technology.

I encourage you to explore this report and engage in a discussion about the future of nuclear power. How do you envision SMRs contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape?

Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should support the expansion of domestic nuclear energy and advanced nuclear technology as a viable source of power in order to promote United States nuclear energy leadership and global energy independence.

Whereas nuclear energy has generated one-fifth of the electricity used in the United States since 1990;

Whereas the Secretary of Energy has stated that, ‚Äúnuclear energy is clean energy and it is vital to creating good-paying jobs, supporting our energy transition, and saving our planet‚Äù;

Whereas the International Energy Agency determined that nuclear power forms the cornerstone of zero-carbon electricity generation;

Whereas conventional nuclear energy plants are highly reliable and consistently operate, on average, over 92 percent of the time;

Whereas the generation of electricity from nuclear energy is up to 2 times more reliable than the generation of electricity from natural gas and coal, and up to 3.5 times more reliable than the generation of electricity from wind and solar;

Whereas nuclear reactors produce substantially more energy relative to their land footprint than solar and wind projects, which require over 30 times and 100 times, respectfully, the land area for the same generating capacity;

Whereas 482,000,000 metric tons of carbon emissions were avoided by using nuclear energy in 2021;

Whereas, in 2019, 476,000,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions were not released into the atmosphere due to the utilization of nuclear energy in the United States, which is equivalent to removing 100,000,000 cars off the road;

Whereas conversely, in 2014, Vermont‚Äôs Yankee Nuclear Plant closed and the State saw a 650,000-metric ton increase in carbon dioxide emissions within just 2 months;

Whereas electricity demand throughout the United States is predicted to increase by approximately 34 percent by 2050;

Whereas, as of July 8, 2020, there are 28 States in which at least 1 commercial nuclear reactor operates;

Whereas many States around the United States have enacted nuclear energy-related laws and are in the process of adopting policies and appropriating funding for the expansion of nuclear energy in their State;

Whereas nuclear energy facilities can repurpose retired fossil fuel power plants by using existing infrastructure and transitioning fossil fuel power plant workers that already understand the basics of operating the nuclear energy facility;

Whereas, in 2022, nuclear energy supported over 475,000 well-paying, sustainable, direct and indirect jobs throughout the American nuclear industry;

Whereas building a conventional nuclear reactor employs up to 7,000 workers at peak construction;

Whereas nuclear energy worker salaries are, on average, 50 percent higher than the salaries of employees that work in other electricity generation facilities;

Whereas the United States nuclear energy industry spends roughly $11,000,000,000 annually on labor, which is approximately $100,000,000 per reactor per year;

Whereas, for every 100 jobs at a nuclear power plant in the United States, 66 other jobs are created in the local community;

Whereas nearly 1 in 4 nuclear energy workers are veterans;

Whereas nuclear energy adds approximately $60,000,000,000 to the United States gross domestic product each year;

Whereas, unlike most energy sources, nuclear power plants have up to 2 years of fuel stored securely on-site, which makes nuclear power plants hardened against fuel-related supply chain disruptions;

Whereas a uranium pellet the size of a pencil eraser contains the same amount of energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 1,780 pounds of coal, or 149 gallons of oil;

Whereas 5 uranium pellets generate enough electricity to power the average household annually, which compares to the same amount of electricity produced by 5 tons of coal;

Whereas global uranium supply is vastly available and the United States can generate nuclear power at its current levels for more than a century with just the natural uranium ore deposits that have already been identified;

Whereas nuclear power plants offer a level of protection against natural and adversarial threats that goes far beyond the protective measures taken at most other American energy generating facilities;

Whereas nuclear power plants‚Äô infrastructure and facilities are built to withstand extreme weather, as proven during past and recent hurricanes and freezing temperatures driven by polar vortex events;

Whereas the safe operation of nuclear energy in the United States has resulted in no radiation-related deaths or long-term evacuation of surrounding communities;

Whereas the utilization of conventional and advanced nuclear energy technologies will significantly reduce energy costs, although the initial investment burden of licensing and constructing any type of nuclear reactor will be substantial;

Whereas the production of nuclear energy has become a much safer and more efficient process with the development and commercialization of innovative advanced nuclear reactors;

Whereas advanced nuclear reactors present uniquely innovative options for the sustainable generation of clean energy in the United States and around the world;

Whereas a typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in the United States requires approximately one square mile of land to operate, however an advanced nuclear reactor requires about 3 times less land area compared to a conventional nuclear power plant, depending on the reactor type and the specific characteristics of the community;

Whereas the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates 31 research and test reactors;

Whereas approximately 98 universities in the United States offer a nuclear engineering program and several universities have expressed interest in advanced nuclear reactors as a power source for their campuses;

Whereas more than 45 companies and research organizations across the United States have advanced nuclear energy projects underway;

Whereas many advanced nuclear reactors, in comparison to conventional nuclear reactors, can operate at much higher temperatures without water, have built in safety features (such as automatic shutoff mechanisms), can operate autonomously without disruption for several years at a time, and have a naturally enhanced resistance to nuclear proliferation;

Whereas low-emission heat and steam from advanced nuclear reactors can supply reliable, clean energy for hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as the industrial sector and chemical production sector;

Whereas the total amount of spent nuclear fuel produced over the tenure of the United States nuclear energy industry could fit within the bounds of a football field at a depth of less than 10 yards;

Whereas spent nuclear fuel can‚Äî

(1) be safely stored in a deep geological repository;

(2) be repurposed and recycled using innovative technology; and

(3) potentially be safely stored underground using techniques such as deep borehole drilling;

Whereas certain advanced nuclear reactors have the capability to use spent nuclear fuel from another nuclear reactor as a fuel source;

Whereas recycling spent nuclear fuel could significantly reduce the burden of storing spent nuclear fuel, which would make the nuclear fuel cycle more sustainable and further reduce the already-low carbon footprint of nuclear energy;

Whereas 96 percent of spent nuclear fuel content is reusable energy, and recycling spent nuclear fuel can cut the use of natural uranium resources by 25 percent, reduce the volume of high-level waste slated for disposal by 75 percent, and reduce the waste‚Äôs toxicity by approximately 90 percent;

Whereas spent nuclear fuel can be reprocessed up to 3 cycles;

Whereas, by 2050, energy produced by advanced nuclear reactors may account for a significant amount of the clean energy generated in the United States, with certain estimates predicting that up to 50 percent of total United States electricity generation could come from conventional and advanced nuclear energy sources;

Whereas the offsite component fabrication and modular manufacturing process for advanced nuclear reactors will likely lead to cheaper and faster installation, reduced regulatory burdens, and ultimately a streamlined commercial deployment of advanced nuclear reactors;

Whereas advanced nuclear reactors offer seamless integration to complement other renewables within microgrids, balancing out variations in generation over time to reliably meet demand in the United States;

Whereas, in the aftermath of a natural disaster when power outages persist, an easily transportable advanced nuclear reactor could provide electricity or heat for essential services, such as hospitals, airports, communications centers, government offices, and water purification facilities, instead of diesel generators, thereby producing a cleaner and more efficient source of power that can last up to 20 years without refueling;

Whereas nuclear medicine, including the use of medical radioactive isotopes, can be used to diagnose and treat different diseases with pinpoint precision, which will ultimately save American lives;

Whereas radioactivity used for medical diagnostics and treatments is elementally the same as that used for nuclear power;

Whereas medical isotopes are made in nuclear reactors;

Whereas, with advances in nuclear science and technology, and new approaches to the medical application of radioisotope technology, outcomes for cancer patients have improved tremendously;

Whereas nuclear power plants produce a vital resource in the global fight against COVID‚Äì19: Cobalt‚Äì60, which has sterilized billions of pieces of medical equipment in hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic;

Whereas nuclear radiation is used to treat food and kill bacteria, insects, and parasites that cause illness;",2022freedom22,0,2,0,0

#NJ27thLD raised the the issue through proper channels to @NJBPU and the @GovMurphy Administration.

Nothing.

Why were they selling us on our ""Bulk Purchasing Power"" when we should have already had an underlying systemic accountability to begin with?

If an Ohio nuclear facility can provide power at 4.8¬¢ per kWh, why can't our NJ nuclear facilities do the same? Which institutions hold the debt that artificially leverages ""cost.""

Good-intending citizens were being upsold on purchasing all their power as ""green"" with zero accountability for the commissions. We were being taken advantage of. Where was the NJBPU President to protect our interests?

To step forward into OSW now without ever having worked through the prior issues will leave us at the mercy of powerful players who apparently sit on both sides of traditional and renewable power, opening ourselves to decades of legal institutionalized racketeering on pricing. 

Rather than inching forward into the abyss, with stronger leadership we can take a big step back and impose a new underlying systemic accountability.   

And if OSW works, that's great, but show us the pro-formas. And somebody has got to honestly deal with the dead whale issue. Lastly, renewables only really make sense if the post-capitalization value accountably flows as savings to the ratepayer. 

It is time for a fresh approach to accounting for what it is that we actually value. We shouldn't need to wait for the next administration. The time to act is now.
