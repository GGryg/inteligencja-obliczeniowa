üíªüîåüí∞ Terawulf Launches First Bitcoin Mining Powered by Nuclear Energy in US

Terawulf, a company engaged in Bitcoin mining, announced that it has launched the first Bitcoin mining installation powered by nuclear energy in the United States at Nautilus company in Pennsylvania. According to the company, approximately 1 exahash per second (EH/s) or around 8000 bitcoin miners with integrated circuits are currently connected to the network, and another 8000 mining units will be delivered soon.

According to the company's press release on Nautilus energization, Terawulf will receive a fixed electricity tariff of about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the next five years.

The Nautilus facility is considered a milestone, as it is the first Bitcoin mining enterprise of its kind to receive 24/7 carbon-free energy from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

Seven days ago, Mawson Infrastructure Group launched a mining company in Pennsylvania, after leaving Australia. In addition to the 50 MW Nautilus installation, Terawulf announced an expansion of operations at its Lake Mariner facility in New York. This move will increase Lake Mariner's capacity from 60 MW to 110 MW.

We are witnessing the extreme centralization of mining in the US, which has already captured the lion's share of the world's hash rate. And the problem here is not only that the main mining pools are located in one country. A couple of years ago, the lion's share of mining pools were in China. The problem is precisely that there are no pools in the US at all.

Previously, the dominance of Chinese pools in the Bitcoin network was a concern, but most of these pools could be joined by a miner from anywhere in the world, and only one was purely Chinese. All others were open to miners from any country. Now, in the US, there is a mega-concentration of miners at individual companies, with no possibility for third-party players to join their pools.

Moreover, the cooperation of large energy companies and nuclear power plants, owned by Goldman Sachs' investment division, raises suspicion that the most active bank in the crypto industry wants to concentrate almost all Bitcoin mining in its hands.

For example, the Chief Strategy Officer of this largest atomic miner in the US, Kerri Langlais, attracted funding to buy these 8000 miners easily. Again, by a strange coincidence, Kerri worked for the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs for the previous 10 years.

üìåConclusion:
Overall, the article highlights the growing importance of energy sources for Bitcoin mining, and the impact that centralized mining power can have on the Bitcoin network.
