As a passionate follower of this technology, I've been closely monitoring the progress of SMRs, which promise a safer, more efficient, and sustainable approach to nuclear power generation.

üá®üá≥üá∑üá∫ While China and Russia are at the forefront of this revolution, companies worldwide are racing to bring SMRs to the market. These compact reactors offer numerous advantages, such as exceptional passive safety features, reduced uranium enrichment requirements (some as low as 8.5%), and extended life cycles of up to 60 years.

üåéüå± SMRs have the potential to address many of the historical challenges associated with nuclear energy, including waste management. The latest report from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) offers a comprehensive overview and dashboard of the current state of SMR technology.

I encourage you to explore this report and engage in a discussion about the future of nuclear power. How do you envision SMRs contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape?
